This repo contains a bash script named “cars.sh” that will help a user maintain an inventory of old cars.
 
 The user will be presented with a menu of three options:
 1 - Prompts the user for year, make, and model of a new car and adds it to the list of old cars
 2 - Prints all of the cars in the list of old cars
 3 - Says "Goodbye" and exits the program
